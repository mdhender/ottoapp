                <li>ðŸŽ¯ Hexes that your units have seen, but never actually entered, are marked with a large yellow X.
                </li>
                <li>ðŸŽ¯ Hexes that scouts have entered have a small S near the right edge.</li>
                <li>ðŸŽ¯ The map coordinates (eg PQ 0213) are displayed in the lower left corner of each hex.</li>
                <li>
                    ðŸŽ¯ Rivers are displayed as a blue line along the hex edge.
                    Canals are displayed as a slightly darker blue line.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ðŸŽ¯ Your units are displayed as a black figure on the upper right edge.
                    Other players' units are displayed as a red figure on the upper left edge.
                    If there's only a single unit in the hex, then the unit's number is displayed.
                    Otherwise, "clan" is displayed above the unit and the list of units is attached as a note to the
                    figure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ðŸŽ¯ Settlements are displayed as a black town icon in the center of the hex.
                    The name of the settlement is displayed along the bottom edge of the hex.
                    NB: If the settlement name looks like "L 1234", then there's a typo in your report that you should
                    fix.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ðŸŽ¯ The yellow or black pillboxes connecting hexes represent passes or fords.
                    NB: if only half a pillbox is visible, this usually means that the neighboring hex hasn't been
                    entered.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ðŸŽ¯ Ocean and lakes can be hard to tell apart.
                    You can ask OttoMap to change the color of the ocean to make it easier to see.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ðŸŽ¯ Units with wagons can't enter Swamp or Jungle Hill hexes.
                    The report shows "Cannot Move Wagons into Swamp/Jungle Hill," which doesn't show the true terrain
                    type. OttoMap will show a large yellow "?" in the hex until one of your units reports on the true
                    terrain type.
                </li>
